# WhatsApp Notification Testing Guide

## Issue Resolution

You mentioned clicking "Send" at `http://localhost:3000/admin/whatsapp` but not receiving notifications. Here's what was happening and how to fix it:

### What Was Wrong:
1. **Placeholder Credentials**: Your `.env.local` had placeholder values that looked real to the system
2. **Invalid API Calls**: The system tried to use fake credentials
3. **Port Confusion**: App was running on port 3002, you were testing on port 3000

### What's Fixed:
1. **Console Mode Enabled**: Removed placeholder credentials to enable safe testing
2. **Server Restarted**: Now running on port 3000 as expected
3. **Proper Testing Setup**: Messages will now log to terminal

## How to Test WhatsApp Notifications Now

### Step 1: Check Current Status
1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000/admin/whatsapp
2. **Should show**: "Console Mode (Testing)" status
3. **This means**: Messages will be logged to terminal instead of sent via WhatsApp

### Step 2: Test Manual Notification
1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/admin/whatsapp
2. **Select any program** from the dropdown
3. **Click "Send Notification"**
4. **Check your terminal** - you should see messages like:
   ```
   [WhatsApp Console] Sending to +1234567890: üèõÔ∏è New City Program Alert!
   Program: [Program Name]
   Description: [Program Description]
   Category: [Program Category]
   ```

### Step 3: Test Automatic Notification
1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/admin (main admin panel)
2. **Create a new program**
3. **After saving**, check your terminal for automatic WhatsApp notifications
4. **All users with phone numbers** should get notified (in console)

### Step 4: Monitor Terminal Output
Keep your terminal window open to see all WhatsApp activity:
- Manual notifications from admin panel
- Automatic notifications when creating programs
- Any errors or issues

## Expected Terminal Output

When you send a notification, you should see:
```
[WhatsApp Console] Bulk notification sent successfully
[WhatsApp Console] Sending to +91xxxxxxxxxx: üèõÔ∏è New City Program Alert!
Program: Green Energy Initiative
Description: Community solar panel installation program
Category: Environment

Stay informed about city programs and services!

Best regards,
City Management System
[WhatsApp Console] Message sent successfully to +91xxxxxxxxxx
```

## To Enable Real WhatsApp (Optional)

If you want to test with real WhatsApp messages later:

1. **Follow**: `META_WHATSAPP_QUICK_SETUP.md`
2. **Get real credentials** from Meta Developer Console
3. **Add to `.env.local`**:
   ```env
   WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN=your_real_token_here
   WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_real_phone_id_here
   ```
4. **Restart server**

## Troubleshooting

### Not seeing terminal output?
- Make sure you're looking at the correct terminal window
- Try creating a program - should trigger automatic notifications
- Check that your users have phone numbers in the database

### Still showing old configuration?
- Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Clear browser cache
- Restart the development server

### Want to add test users?
- Go to signup page and create test users with phone numbers
- Or manually add phone numbers to existing users in database

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check WhatsApp config status
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/config" -Method GET

# Check available programs
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/programs" -Method GET
```

Now try testing again at http://localhost:3000/admin/whatsapp - you should see WhatsApp messages in your terminal!
